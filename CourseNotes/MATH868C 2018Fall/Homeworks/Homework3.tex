\begin{problem}
Let $\Omega \subset \Bbb C^n$ be open and let $P$ be a polydisk, whose closure is contained in  $\Omega$. Show that $\widehat{\partial_0 P}_\Omega = \overline{P}$, where ${\partial_0 P}$ is the distinguished boundary of $P$

\begin{problem}
$\Bbb C^n$ can be viewed as a $2n$-dimensional real vector space and an $n$-dimensional complex vector space. Show that any $\Bbb R$-linear functional on $\Bbb C^n$ is the real part of a $\Bbb C$-linear functional on $\Bbb C^n$
