Distribution measure of a random variable $X$ is such that $\mu_X(B)=\mathbb P(X\in B)$

Change of measure:
Suppose $P$ and $\tilde P$ are equivalent measures(same null set), then $Z=d\tilde P/dP$, where $Z:\Omega\to\mathbb R$ is an almost surely positive random variable with $EZ=1$

Suppose $X$ is a random variable, then $\sigma(X)$ is the smallest sigma algebra such that $X$ is measurable, i.e. generated by $\{X\in B\}$, $B$ are Borel sets

Suppose $\mathcal F_t$ is a filtration of sigma algebras, $X_t$ $\mathcal F_t$ measurable is a random process

$\mathcal F$, $\mathcal G$ is independent if $\mathbb P(A\cup B)=\mathcal P(A)\mathcal P(B)$ for $A,B$ in $\mathcal F$, $\mathcal G$, $X, Y$ are independent if $\sigma(X)$ and $\sigma(Y)$ are independent

$(X,Y):\Omega^2\to\mathbb R^2$ defines $\mu_{X,Y}(C)=\mathbb P((X(\omega),Y(\omega))\in C)$

$\mathbb E[X|\mathcal G]$ is the random variable such that
$$
\int_A\mathbb E[X|\mathcal G]d\mathbb P=\int_AXd\mathbb P
$$
for all $A\in\mathbb G$. And $\mathbb E[X|Y]=\mathbb E[X,\sigma(Y)]$
