### Basic definitions
Suppose $(X,\Sigma)$ is a measurable space
- $\mu$ is a $\sigma$-_finite_ measure if $X=\bigcup_n\{A_n\}$ for some $\{A_n\}$ such that $\mu(A_n)<\infty$
- $\mu<<\nu$ ($\mu$ is _absolutely continuous_ with respect to $\nu$) if $\nu(A)=0\Rightarrow\mu(A)=0$
- _Radon-Nikodym theorem_: $\mu,\nu$ are $\sigma$-finite measures such that $\mu<<\nu$, then there exists a non-negative measurable function $f:X\to[0,\infty)$ such that
    ```math
    \mu(A) = \int_Afd\nu
    ```
    $f$ is uniquely defined up to a $\mu$-null set, and is called the _Radonâ€“Nikodym derivative_ $\dfrac{d\mu}{d\nu}$. If $g$ is $\mu$ measurable, then
    ```math
    \int_Agd\mu = \int_Ag\dfrac{d\mu}{d\nu}d\nu
    ```

Suppose $(\Omega,\mathcal F,\mathbb P)$ is a probability space

- A _random variable_ is a measurable function $X:(\Omega,\mathcal F)\to(\mathbb R,\mathcal B)$, $\mathcal B$ is the Borel algebra
- Suppose $A\in\mathcal F$, the _indicator random variable_ $1_A$ is such that $1_A(\omega)=1\iff \omega\in A$
- The _expectation_ of a random variable is $\mathbb E(X)=\displaystyle\int_\Omega Xd\mathbb P$
- The _distribution measure_ on $\mathbb R$ of a random variable $X$ is such that $\mu_X(B)=\mathbb P(X\in B)$, i.e. the pushforward measure $X_*\mathbb P=\mathbb P\circ X^{-1}$
- Suppose $X$ is a random variable, then $\sigma(X)$ is the smallest sigma algebra such that $X$ is measurable, i.e. generated by $\{X\in B\}$, $B$ are Borel sets
- $\sigma(1_A) = \{\varnothing, A, A^c, \Omega\}$
- $X$ is $\mathcal G$ measurable if $\sigma(X)\subseteq\mathcal G$
- Suppose $\mathbb P$ and $\tilde{\mathbb P}$ are equivalent measures(same null set), $Z=d\tilde{\mathbb P}/d\mathbb P$, then $Z$ is an almost surely positive such that $\mathbb EZ=1$, it is easy to see $\tilde{\mathbb E}(X)=\mathbb E(XZ)$

### Conditional probability
- $\mathcal F$, $\mathcal G$ is independent if $\mathbb P(A\cap B)=\mathcal P(A)\mathcal P(B)$ for $A,B$ in $\mathcal F$, $\mathcal G$, $X, Y$ are independent if $\sigma(X)$ and $\sigma(Y)$ are independent
- A joint random variable $(X,Y):\Omega^2\to\mathbb R^2$ defines a joint measure $\mu_{X,Y}(C)=\mathbb P((X(\omega),Y(\omega))\in C)$
- Suppose $A\in\mathcal F$, $\mathbb P_{|A}(B)=\dfrac{\mathbb P(AB)}{\mathbb P(A)}$ a conditional probability measure $\mathbb P_{|A}$
- $\mathbb E[X|\mathcal G]$ is the $\mathcal G$-measurable random variable such that
    $$
    \int_G\mathbb E[X|\mathcal G]d\mathbb P=\int_GXd\mathbb P
    $$
    for all $G\in\mathcal G$. And $\mathbb E[X|Y]=\mathbb E[X|\sigma(Y)]$
- There exist $\mathcal G$ measurable random variables $Z_{A|\mathbb G}=\dfrac{d\mathbb P_A}{d\mathbb P}$ for all $A\in\mathcal F$ by Radon-Nikodym, this determines the so-called _regular conditional probability_ $\tau$ such that
    * $\tau(\omega,\bullet)$ is a probability measure for all $\omega\in\Omega$
    * $\tau(\bullet,A)$ is a

### Random process
Suppose $\mathcal F_t$ is a filtration of sigma algebras and $X_t$ are $\mathcal F_t$ measurable random variables, then $\{X_t\}$ is called a random process
- If $\mathbb E(X_t|\mathcal F_s)=X_s$ for $s\leq t$, then $X_t$ is a _martingale_
- If $\mathbb E(f(X_t)|\mathcal F_s)=g(X_s)$ for $s\leq t$, then $X_t$ is a _markov process_

### Ito's lemma and Feynman-Kac equation
$W_t$ is a Wiener process and $X_t$ is random process with $dX_t = f(X_t,t)dt + g(X_t,t)dW_t$, then $dX_t^2 = g^2dt$, suppose $f(x,t), g(x,t), u(x,t), \phi(x)$ are all smooth functions, then Ito's lemma says
```math
du = (u_t + u_xf + \frac{1}{2}u_{xx}g^2) dt + u_xgdW
```
note that $u_t, u_x, \frac{1}{2}u_{xx}$, the Feynman-Kac equation
```math
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}
```
has the solution
```math
```

### Notations
- $\mathcal F_t$ is the filtration of informations
- $P_t$ is the price of the asset
- $\displaystyle R(t,T) = \dfrac{1}{T-t}\int_t^Tr_sds$ is the effective interest rate from $t$ to $T$, quoted continuously
- $\displaystyle D(t,T) = \exp\left(-\int_t^Tr_sds\right)$ is the discounted factor from $t$ to $T$
