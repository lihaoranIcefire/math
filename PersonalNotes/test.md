- Self introduction: name, major, hobby, learning goal.
- ADS accommodation: requests must be reported to the instructor.
- Quizzes: 20 minutes at end of Thursday discussions, 11 quizzes in total, and 2 will be dropped, no make ups regardless of any excuses.
- Office hours: 4pm-5pm, Tuesdays & Thursdays, MATH0206
- Format: First I would like to make a super quick review if necessary, then I will address any problems from the homework or the lecture, after that, there are problems suggested by the instructor that we can go through.
- Remark: Please do come to the discussions. It is a great chance for you to work on problems with others and get immediate feedbacks.
- Applications: physics, machine learning, fourier analysis
- Reminder: always check the answer for the case of a unique solution.
