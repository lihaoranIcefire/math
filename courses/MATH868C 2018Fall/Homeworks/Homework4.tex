\begin{problem}
Let $\lambda:=(\lambda_1, \ldots,\lambda_j)$, $z:=(z_1, \ldots,z_j)$ and $\xi:=(\xi_1, \ldots,\xi_j)$ be as in the proof of Corollary 2.5.8. Show that
$$ \sum_{i=1}^j \lambda_i \log|z_i| \leq \sup_{\xi \in k} \sum_{i=1}^j \lambda_j \log|\xi_i|, \ \forall \lambda\in \Bbb R^n_+ \ \ \text{ with } \ \lambda_1 + \ldots + \lambda_j =1$$
is equivalent with $(\log|z_1|,\ldots,\log|z_j|)$ being in the convex hull of the set of all points $(\eta_1,\ldots,\eta_j)$ such that  $\eta_i \leq \log |\xi_i|$ for $1 \leq i \leq j$. [Hint: One direction is easy. For show that being in the convex hull implies the inequality use the fact that a closed convex set is always the intersection of half spaces]

\begin{problem}
Let $\delta$ as defined by H\"ormander on page 37. Show that $z \to \delta(z,\Omega^c)$ is a continuous on $\Bbb C^n$, where $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\Bbb C^n$
