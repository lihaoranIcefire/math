\begin{exercise}
For $R$ a commutative ring and $P$ an $R$-module, we have $P$ finitely generated projective $\iff$ for every $p\in\Spec R$, $\exists s\notin p$ with $P[\frac{1}{s}]$ finitely generated and free. This implies that for every $p \in \Spec R$, $P_p$ is finitely generated and free, and that condition is equivalent if $R$ is Noetherian. Show that $R$ not Noetherian, the conditions are not equivalent, i.e., it could be that $P_p$ is finitely generated free for every prime ideal $p$, but $P$ is not finitely generated projective

\begin{exercise}
Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Show that $\Spec R$ (with the Zariski topology) is a connected topological space (i.e., is not the disjoint union of two non-empty open sets) $\iff$ the only idempotents in $R$ are 0 and 1. (We mentioned this in class but didnâ€™t prove it.) In particular, $\Spec R$ is connected if $R$ is an integral domain

Work out the details of Example I.3.10.1 in Weibel: if $k$ is a field and $R = k[t^2,t^3]$, a subring of $k[t]$, then $\Pic(R)\cong k$(the additive group of the field), with the isomorphism sending $\alpha\in k^\times$ to the ideal of $R$ generated by $I_\alpha = R \cap (t-\alpha^{-1})k[t]$ and sending $0\in k$ to $R$ itself(So $I_\alpha$ is the ideal of $R$ gotten by intersecting $R$ with the ideal generated by $t-\alpha^{-1}$ in $k[t]$). Since $I_\alpha$ is obviously an ideal, it is an $R$-module. Show that it is locally free of rank 1, and that all non-trivial line bundles on $R$ are isomorphic to ones arising this way
