First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my academic advisor, Christian K. Zickert, who not only provided me fasinating projects to work on but also offered constant support throughout my research, generously sharing his insights and wisdom.

I am also grateful to Zachary Greenberg, who collaborated with me on multiple problems and has given me numerous valuable suggestions, both in conducting research and in navigating life as a graduate student.

Additionally, I am thankful to have been surrounded by many kind and talented friends, who have made my time at the University of Maryland so much more enjoyable.

I am very appreciative of the staff at the Mathematics department: Anh, Cristina, Elizabeth, Jakie, Jemma, Ruth and Trystan, who have regularly assisted me on various issues. Thanks to your help, I don't have to worry too much about matters beyond my research.

Lastly, I would like to especially thank my parents Weiguo, Yunfang and my partner Ming, who have stood by my side through the ups and downs of my graduate studies. It is because of you that I am able to maintain a positive outlook on my life and consistently work hard to improve myself.
