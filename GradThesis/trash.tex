Chapter 4 is partially joint work with Zachary Greenberg, Dani Kaufman and Christian K. Zickert~\cite{ZDHZ_HopfAlgebrasOfMultiplePolylogarithmsAndHolomorphicOneForms}. In this chapter, we construct ``lifted'' variation matrix consists of ``lifted'' multiple polylogarithms which underlies a variation of ``lifted'' mixed Hodge structures, and in particular, the columns of the matrix generates the flat sections of a trivial vector bundle with a integrable flat connection, and its connection form consists of associated differential one-forms. Zhao has previously shown that columns of ordinary variation matrices $\Re(V^{\overline{\mathbb H}})$ generate the sections of trivial vector bundle over $S_d(\mathbb C)$ with the flat connection $\nabla=d-\omega$, where $\omega$ is simply the differential of the variation matrix, as well as the connection form. Moreover, filtrations on columns define variation of mixed Hodge structures over $S_d(\mathbb C)$. Similarly, we will construct a ``lifted'' variation matrix $\Re(\widehat V^{\mathbb H})$ by ``lifting'' ordinary multiple polylogarithms, and prove that columns of the variation matrix generate the sections of a trivial vector bundle over $\widehat S_d(\mathbb C)$ with flat connection $\widehat\nabla=d-\widehat\omega$, where $\widehat\omega$ is the associated differential one-forms. And filtrations on the variation matrix define variation of ``lifted'' mixed Hodge structures over $\widehat S_d(\mathbb C)$.
