<li>
<p>Sketch the following surfaces<br />
a. An ellipsoid with longest radius along \(y\)-axis and give an example<br />
One such example could be \(x^2+\dfrac{y^2}{4}+z^2=1\).<br />
b. A parabolic sheet parallel to the \(z\)-axis and give an example<br />
One such example could be \(y=x^2\).<br />
c. A cylinder parallel to the \(x\)-axis and give an example<br />
One such example could be \(y^2+z^2=1\).<br />
d. \(x^2-y^2+z^2=0\)<br />
This surface equation can be turn into \(y^2=x^2+z^2\) which is a double cone.<br />
e. \(y=x^2+2z^2\)<br />
This is a paraboloid.<br />
f. A level surface of \(f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2-z\)<br />
The level surfaces are \(f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2-z=c\) for arbitrary \(c\), this is a collections of paraboloids \(z=x^2+y^2-c\) with \(z\)-intercept \((0,0,-c)\)<br />
g. The graph of \(f(x,y)=\sqrt{4-x^2-y^2}\)<br />
This is the upper hemisphere of radius 2 centered at the origin.<br />

</li>
<li>
<p>What are the intersections of the surfaces like?<br />
a. \(x^2+y^2=4\) and \(x^2+y^2+z^2=25\)<br />
The intersection of a cylinder and a sphere with bigger radius is two circles.<br />
b. \(z=x^2\) and \(z=10\)<br />
The intersection of a parabolic sheet with plane parallel to it is two lines.<br />
c. \(x=y^2\) and \(z=10\)<br />
The intersection of a parabolic sheet with plane perpendicular to it is a parabola.<br />
d. \(x+y-z=5\) and \(x+y+2z=10\)<br />
Since the normal vectors \(\mathbf n_1=(1,1,-1)\), \(\mathbf n_2=(1,1,2)\) are not parallel, they meet in a line.<br />

<!--3. Suppose a particle is moving through space has trajectory ``\mathbf r(t)=(\frac{t^2}{2}-\ln t)\mathbf i-\mathbf j+2t\mathbf k``.
    a. At what time does particle strike the plane ``2x-y+z=4``? What is the particle's position and velocity at that instant?
    b. Find the length of the trajectory of the particle from ``t=1`` to ``t=3``.
    c. Decide whether ``\mathbf r(t)`` is a smooth parametrization for ``t>0``.

4. Suppose ``A=(2,1,3)`` and the line ``\ell`` given by ``\dfrac{x-1}{2}=-y=\dfrac{z-2}{3}``
