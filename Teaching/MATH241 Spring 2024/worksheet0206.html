<ol>
<li>
<p>Find parametric and symmetric equations for the line containing the points (-1, 1, 0) and (-2, 5, 7).</p>
<p>Recall that the symmetric equation for the line passing through \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\) with line vector \((a,b,c)\) is</p>
\[\dfrac{x-x_0}{a}=\dfrac{y-y_0}{b}=\dfrac{z-z_0}{c}
\]
<p>Suppose \(P=(-1, 1, 0)\) and \(Q=(-2, 5, 7)\), the line vector \(\mathbf L=\overrightarrow{PQ}=(-1,4,7)\), so the symmetric equation of this line could be</p>
\[\dfrac{x+1}{-1}=\dfrac{y-1}{4}=\dfrac{z}{7}
\]
</li>
<li>
<p>(\(\S 11.5\), 20) Find the distance \(D\) from the point \((2, 1, 0)\) to the line with equations \(x=-2\), \(y+1=z\).</p>
<p>We can pick any point on the line, say \(P=(-2,0,1)\), and assume \(Q=(2,1,0)\). We also know the line vector to be \(\mathbf L=(0,1,1)\) from the symmetric line equation \(\ell\). Therefore</p>
\[\operatorname{dist}(Q,\ell)=\dfrac{\|\overrightarrow{PQ}\times\mathbf L\|}{\|\mathbf L\|}=\dfrac{\|(4,1,-1)\times(0,1,1)\|}{\|(0,1,1)\|}=\dfrac{\|(2,-4,4)\|}{\|(0,1,1)\|}=\dfrac{6}{\sqrt2}=3\sqrt2
\]
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide whether the following planes meet or not<br />
a. \(2x+y-z=10\) and \(4x+2y-2z=10\)<br />
b. \(2x+y-z=10\) and \(4x+2y-2z=20\)<br />
c. \(2x+y-z=10\) and \(4x+2y-z=10\)</p>
<p>Suppose \(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are two plane equations with normal vectors \(\mathbf n_1,\mathbf n_2\) respectively, then exactly one of the following 3 statements is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are non-parallel and intersect at a line</li>
<li>\(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are parallel and overlapping</li>
<li>\(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are parallel yet non-overlapping</li>
</ul>
<p>And \(\pi_1,\pi_2\) are overlapping when the whole equation of \(\pi_1\) is an exact multiple of that of \(\pi_2\). Also recall that</p>
\[\pi_1\parallel\pi_2\iff\mathbf n_1\parallel\mathbf n_2,\qquad\pi_1\perp\pi_2\iff\mathbf n_1\perp\mathbf n_2
\]
<p>a. normal vectors \(\mathbf n_1=(2,1,-1)\) is half of \(\mathbf n_2=(4,2,-2)\), so \(\mathbf n_1\parallel\mathbf n_2\Rightarrow\pi_1\parallel\pi_2\), however, \(4x+2y-2z=10\) is not an exact multiple of \(2x+y-z=10\). So they are parallel yet non-overlapping.<br />
b. Like part a., we have \(\mathbf n_1\parallel\mathbf n_2\Rightarrow\pi_1\parallel\pi_2\), and we see that \(4x+2y-2z=20\) is exactly twice of \(2x+y-z=10\), so these two equations describes the same set of points, i.e., they are overlapping.<br />
c. \(\mathbf n_1=(2,1,-1)\) is not a multiple of \(\mathbf n_2=(4,2,-1)\), so they are not parallel and intersect at a line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(\(\S 11.6\), 6) Find an equation of the plane that contains the points \((2, -1, 4)\), \((5, 3, 5)\), and \((2, 4, 3)\).</p>
<p>Suppose \(P=(2, -1, 4)\), \(Q=(5, 3, 5)\) and \(R=(2, 4, 3)\), then we can choose the normal vector to this plane to be</p>
\[\mathbf n=\overrightarrow{PQ}\times\overrightarrow{PR}=(3,4,1)\times(0,5,-1)=(-9,3,15)
\]
<p>since \(\mathbf n\) must be perpendicular to both \(\overrightarrow{PQ}\), \(\overrightarrow{PR}\). So the plane equation would be</p>
\[-9(x-2)+3(y+1)+15(z-4)=0
\]
</li>
<li>
<p>(\(\S 11.6\), 13) Find the distance \(D\) between the point \((3, -1, 4)\) and the plane \(2x - y + z = 5\).</p>
<p>We can choose any point on the plane, say \(P=(1,1,4)\), and assume \(Q=(3,-1,4)\), we know the normal vector is \(\mathbf n=(2,-1,1)\) from the plane equation \(\pi\). Therefore</p>
\[D=\operatorname{dist}(P,\pi)=\dfrac{|\overrightarrow{PQ}\cdot\mathbf n|}{\|\mathbf n\|}=\dfrac{|(2,-2,0)\cdot(2,-1,1)|}{\|(2,-1,1)\|}=\dfrac{6}{\sqrt6}=\sqrt6
\]
</li>
<li>
<p>(\(\S 11.6\), 11) Let \(l\) be the intersection of the two planes \(2x - 3y + 4z = 2\) and \(x - z = 1\)<br />
a. Find a vector equation of \(l\).</p>
<p>First we know that the normal vectors for planes \(2x - 3y + 4z = 2\) and \(x - z = 1\) are \(\mathbf n_1=(2,-3,4)\) and \(\mathbf n_2=(1,0,-1)\). Note that \(\mathbf L\) are perpendicular to both \(\mathbf n_1,\mathbf n_2\), so it can be chosen to be the cross product</p>
\[\mathbf L=\mathbf n_1\times\mathbf n_2=(2,-3,4)\times(1,0,-1)=(3,6,3)
\]
<p>We can also choose any point on the line \(l\), say \(P_0=(1,0,0)\), then the vector equation of \(l\) would be</p>
\[\mathbf r(t)=P_0+t\mathbf L=(1,0,0)+t(3,6,3)=(1+3t,6t,3t)
\]
<p>b. Find an equation of the plane that is perpendicular to \(l\) and contains the point \((-9, 12, 14)\).</p>
<p>Suppose the plane that is perpendicular to \(l\) and contains the point \(P=(-9, 12, 14)\) is denoted \(\pi\), then a choice of normal vector could simply be the line vector of \(l\), i.e. \(\mathbf n=\mathbf L=(3,6,3)\), so the plane equation of \(\pi\) would be</p>
\[3(x+9)+6(y-12)+3(z-14)=0
\]
</li>
<li>
<p>(\(\S 11.6\), 23) Show that the points \((2, 3, 2)\), \((1, -1, -3)\), \((1, 0, -1)\), and \((5, 9, 5)\) all lie on the same plane.</p>
<p>Suppose \(P_0=(2, 3, 2)\), \(P_1=(1, -1, -3)\), \(P_2=(1, 0, -1)\), and \(P_3=(5, 9, 5)\), we just need to show that \(\overrightarrow{P_0P_1}\), \(\overrightarrow{P_0P_2}\), \(\overrightarrow{P_0P_3}\) lies on the same plane, which is equivalent to that the triple product \((\overrightarrow{P_0P_1}\times\overrightarrow{P_0P_2})\cdot\overrightarrow{P_0P_3}\) being zero. And we see that</p>
\[(\overrightarrow{P_0P_1}\times\overrightarrow{P_0P_2})\cdot\overrightarrow{P_0P_3}=((-1,-4,-5)\times(-1,-3,-3))\cdot(3,6,3)=(-3,2,-1)\cdot(3,6,3)=0
\]
<p>Therefore these four points indeed lie on the same plane.</p>
